TODO:

Create a zustand store to fetch products and keep other state data related to it. I have a created one for authentication (auth-store.ts).

Create a function to fetch featured products from the url: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/featured-products`
It will return a JSON response as follows:
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "MacBook Pro 16-inch",
            "description": "The MacBook Pro 16-inch with Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, designed for professional-grade performance and stunning visuals.",
            "featured": 1,
            "price": 2499,
            "discountedPrice": 2299.99,
            "stock": 15,
            "categoryName": "Laptops",
            "imageUrl": "https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/8756/as-images.apple.com/is/refurb-mbp16-space-m1-2021?wid=2000&hei=2000&fmt=jpeg&qlt=90&.v=1643239951000"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Then, update the featured-products.tsx file to display the fetched data.
