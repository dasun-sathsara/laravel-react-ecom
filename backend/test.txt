Use php artisan to create necessary files.
I am building an API for an ecommerce app. I have implemented authentication and authorization using Laravel Sanctum.

TODO:

Implement the following relationships. (I have implemented all of them. Check them for me. I am not sure I have done it correctly.)

products: id, name, description, price, discounted_price, category_id, stock, featured, timestamp
product_images: id, product_id, url, is_primary, timestamp

categories: id, name, description, timestamp (create a seeder for this)

orders: id, user_id, status, timestamp
order_items: id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price, total

carts: id, user_id, timestamp
cart_items: id, cart_id, product_id, quantity, price, total
